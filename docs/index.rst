Welcome to JSSP's Documentation!
================================

JSSP is an optimization package for the Job Shop Schedule Problem. |br|
For more information on the specific job shop schedule problem JSSP was designed to solve see the `Problem Description <Problem_description.html>`_ page.

JSSP has two different optimization algorithms: |br|

1. Parallel Tabu Search
2. Genetic Algorithm

For more information on these algorithms see the `Algorithms <Algorithms.html>`_ page.

========
Features
========

1. Find near optimal solutions to flexible job shop schedule problems with sequence dependency setup times.
2. Use of `Cython <https://cython.org/>`_ C extensions for fast execution of code.
3. Plot tabu search and/or genetic algorithm optimization using `plotly <https://plot.ly/>`_.
4. Create gantt charts using `plotly <https://plot.ly/>`_.
5. Create production schedule excel file.
